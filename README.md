Enhanced Check-In Order Ahead Templates
=========
The following HTML and JS templates were designed to help assist POS partners with setting up order ahead functionality in association with PayPal's Mobile In-Store framework.  The templates will not function alone, but should act as a front-end and UI guide while integrating with a backend technology.
